# Movie-Store-Cinema90s
This is a website for a movie/cinema store with only few web pages. Designed just for fun and to imporve my knowledge.

This website includes a welcome page,home page, store page, feedback page, site map page, quiz page and a page with developer information.
I designed this webiste according to my CW in 2nd semester of the 1st year at university. This was supposed to be a group CW but after end of the CW and submission in university, I made this by myself just for fun and to improve my knowledge. 
The group CW website which I designed with a group can also find here through (https://github.com/purnaperamune/CW-WebDesign) this link. 

Please use XAMPP as this is not a responsive website.
